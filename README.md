# Changes in fork

I have added a [./default.nix](./default.nix) to build it for [NixOS](nixos.org). I use it in my nixos config ([calling the package](https://github.com/KoviRobi/nixos-config/blob/master/overlays/mypkgs.nix), [using the package](https://github.com/KoviRobi/nixos-config/blob/19f4658594a2ebd4bd6831bcdf393c1dfbc33f6d/configurations/yoga-book.nix#L18-L19), [using volume up to reset the keyboard](https://github.com/KoviRobi/nixos-config/blob/19f4658594a2ebd4bd6831bcdf393c1dfbc33f6d/configurations/yoga-book.nix#L21-L32))

# Lenovo YogaBook C930 E-Ink for Linux project

#### _tl;dr_ if you want to use the E-Ink keyboard on your YogaBook C930, this project will help you do it.

## Background

The Lenovo YogaBook C930 **_(NOT THE LENOVO YOGA C930!!!!!)_** sports
an innovative all-in-one E-Ink display, touchpad, drawing tablet, and
keyboard instead of a traditional keyboard.

Ubuntu installs without a problem and graphics, sound, wifi, _and even
the Wacom touch-screen and stylus_ work out of the box. The one thing
that doesn't work is the E-Ink keyboard (and, of course, the usual Linux
laptop sleep and wake issues.)

Linux doesn't have much support for E-Ink displays in general, and no
support for E-Ink keyboards. They just haven't really existed until very
recently.

The one in the YogaBook is one-of-a-kind and its protocol is proprietary.
This project is my attempt to reverse-engineer the protocol so that,
first and foremost, there is a useable keyboard under Linux.

However, whilst attempting to do this, I found that it is quite easy to
display images on the E-Ink display too, so I have added it to the
driver.


## PLEASE NOTE

The driver is immature and the protocol is not well understood.
Using the driver may hang your system. It may even _brick_ your system.
I don't believe it's at all likely but: YOUR LAPTOP MAY BECOME UNUSABLE.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.


## Getting started

Do the steps in "Building the module" below. That should get your
keyboard up and running!

Unfortunately if the laptop sleeps or is closed, the driver may not
start again. This needs further investigation (as do other sleep-related
issues the laptop has.)


## Getting the keyboard back after sleep

Install SSH as soon as possible. This will help you get into your laptop
if you need to without rebooting.

Open `enable-eink-kb.sh`. These are reasonably reliable steps to unload
and reload the driver (since the usbhid driver uselessly "claims" the
eink device if it gets loaded first).

If you want to have a desktop icon to restore the keyboard if it gets
stuck:

 * copy the file `enable-eink-kb.desktop` to your Desktop
 * copy `enable-eink-kb.sh` to your /root/ directory
 * allow anyone to run this script by placing it in your `sudoers` file.
   Use the command `sudo visudo` and (assuming you know how to use `vi`)
   add this to the file:

    ALL   ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /root/enable-eink-kb.sh



## Building the module

    sudo apt install linux-headers-generic build-essential

    cd yogabook-c930-linux-eink-driver # wherever you cloned the repo

    cd driver
    sudo make run
    # you may want to run `dmesg` now and check for errors

There are various recipes in the Makefile for development purposes.

**Only when you have tested the driver**, you can run `sudo make install`
to install the kernel module. This will load it at boot time.


# Development & contributing

The driver as-is lets you do a couple of things without needing to do any
kernel programming, as explained in the next section. This is a
work-in-progress.

One very cool thing that might be possible is to make the device a
second display. Perhaps a very simple X windowing system could be run on
it since the device has basic support for rectangular blitting.

There are 4 main areas where I could use help:

 * Further reverse-engineering of the Windows protocol/driver (I have
   made a Wireshark plugin that means this is easier than it sounds).
   This includes features such as drawing, handwriting recognition, and
   other functions that Windows supports,
 * Adding features to the driver and making it more reliable,
 * Working out how to get sleep and wake working reliably,
 * Creating user-space infrastructure, e.g. to use the device as a
   second display, maybe as an X backend, drawing and handwriting
   recognition... ...


## Talking to the driver from userspace

The driver exposes a file interface (detected by udev; seems to be a bit
flaky and disappears sometimes). It comes up as `/dev/eink0` or some
other number.

The commands can be found in `try_parse()` in the driver. As of writing
they are:

    * `init` — runs the initialisation sequence
    * `kb` — enables the keyboard after initialisation
    * `draw` — enables draw mode
    * `blit o x y w h` — does a rectangular copy from the device's
      internal buffer to the screen
    * `xfer o w h` — writes an array of pixels from the host (Linux) to
      the device's internal buffer

`init` and `kb` run automatically when the driver is loaded, so you may
not need them.

All commands are terminated with a newline character. However, _after_
this newline character, the `xfer` command accepts a sequence of bytes
exactly w×h characters long, with no newline at the end. If you stuff up
a command, you will probably have to restart the driver.

Be very careful about `o`, `w` and `h` as who knows what might happen if
you overwrite the wrong part of memory in the device. Probably nothing but
don't say I didn't warn you.

[Here is more info](drawing-images.md) about how to draw images.



## Protocol details

Like much of modern built-in hardware, the E-Ink display actually sits
on a USB bus. Since USB has a simple packet-based protocol, you can
record and analyse the packet exchange using
[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/). This is how the features so far
have been reverse-engineered.

[Here is more info](usb-protocol.md) on the USB protocol.



## Driver code

A good example to look at is `drivers/usb/usb-skeleton.c` in the Linux
tree.
